## Name entity recognizer, phrase chunking with recurrent neural nets

This project applies Recurrent Neural Networks on Name Entity Recognition (NER) and Phrase Chunking (PC). The methodology used is similar for both NER and PC, while some of the differences are explained in the two corresponding Jupyter notebooks: `NameEntityRecognizer.ipynb` and `PhraseChunking.ipynb`. 

While the above notebooks show the thought process, from data ingestion to the final model evaluation, the final version of the developed code is placed in the `nerfunc.py` and `chunkingfunc.py` Python files, respectively. These also contain methods to try out the built models on separate test data, and methods to evaluate a model regarding precision, recall, F1-score and support.

A trained NER model using this project is available here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzAHdK6FA6RrgwhXK-MYgm4NsXP4_O4r/view?usp=sharing">link</a>.
